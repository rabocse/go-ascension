Go Ascension

This repo is used for pure learning and documentation purposes in my eternal Go ascension journey.

I heard about "Go Ascension" in the following podcast:

The trigger for the conversation was the following article:

In a nutshell ascension comes when purposefully consuming manuals cover-to-cover to develop expertise, not to fix a day problem or familiarity, but to deeply become a domain expert.

At the moment I am not a developer but a mere enthusiast of the Go programming language, reason why the "ascension" topic resonated with me when I heard about it.

Hope to be playing around this repo whenever trying something with Go.
